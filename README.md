# Puzzle and Dragons

In a previous version of this same repo I was unable to access the already collected and organized data from the popular Gungho game Puzzles and Dragons, but now is different. Accessing the popular [TsubakiBotPad/pad-data-pipeline](https://github.com/TsubakiBotPad/pad-data-pipeline) I have been able to create a local copy of production ready game data. All is ready for analysis. 

## Goal
The goal is to display the monsters in your monster box that have the highest multipliers in terms of the various filters Gungho provides. 
The secondary goal is to display the two monsters that pair the best together based on leader skills and multipliers. 
This would all be displayed in some kind of graph format. 
Some ideas for graphs include displaying your monsters at various stages of evolution and displaying their stats in a line-graph.

## TODO's
- [ ] Find a way to incorporate the various pre-built tsubaki bot cogs into your project. The damage calculator and other leader comparisons are good options.
